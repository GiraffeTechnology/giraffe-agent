"""Semantic provenance tracking for RFQ fields.

Core product rule (PRD §2.3): AIVAN may *preserve* what a user said, but it may
not treat raw text as canonical authority. A canonical value (product,
destination, supplier, quality) is trustworthy only when it carries an
authoritative source. Raw evidence alone (``raw_text_only``) must trigger human
confirmation, never execution.

Field provenance is recorded on the requirement under
``requirement.extra["field_sources"]`` (written by the intake layer) and, when
the giraffe-language-skill was used, mirrored from
``requirement.extra["language_skill"]["field_sources"]``. This module reads those
markers; it never guesses canonical meaning itself.
