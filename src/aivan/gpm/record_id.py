"""giraffe-db record-id contract (consumer side).

Ownership:

* giraffe-db owns the canonical DB record-ID contract. The authoritative
  definition (entity codes, canonical/legacy regexes, generator, scanner,
  reusable tests) lives in ``GiraffeTechnology/giraffe-db``
  (``generators/id_convention.py`` + ``scripts/check_unified_data_ids.py``).
* AIVAN does **not** define the canonical DB contract and does not vendor the
  cross-repo scanner. CI consumes the giraffe-db-owned scanner instead.
* This module performs only *consumer-side request-boundary validation*: when a
  value entering an AIVAN route is meant to be a giraffe-db DB-backed record id,
  a retired ``<ENTITY>_SYN_<digits>`` legacy id is rejected -- never silently
  remapped. The entity codes / patterns below are a minimal local mirror of the
  giraffe-db contract, kept narrow on purpose; they are not a second source of
  truth.
* AIVAN's own identifier namespace is separate and stays valid. ``sup_001``,
  ``supplier_001``, marketplace ids, conversation-derived ids, OpenClaw sender
  ids, ``gpm_pkt_*`` and ``tenant_id`` are passed through untouched. Only the
  unambiguous retired giraffe-db legacy shape is treated as invalid input.
